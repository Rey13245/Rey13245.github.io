        <h3><b><u>The name that started it all</u></b></h3>
        <p>“PageRank” was Google’s web searching algorithm, placing the search engine on top of all others. Currently not the one in use by Google, but certainly the most known, as it was deployed with unmatched efficiency in 1998, what allowed Google to dominate the market making its founders billionaires.</p>
        <h3><b><u>How it came to be</u></b></h3>
        <p>Influenced by the RankDex site-scoring algorithm for search engines results page ranking by Robin Li, a Chinese now billionaire software engineer, and by a citation analysis developed by Eugene Garfield an American linguist and businessman back in the 1950s, and by the Italian mathematician and computer scientist Massimo Marchiori’s Hyper Search, PageRank was developed at Stanford University by Sergey Brin and Larry page, hence the name “PageRank, with the help of Scott Hassan and Alan Steremberg, as part of a research project about a new search engine and published in 1998, shortly before Google Inc. was founded.</p>
        <h3><b><u>How it works</u></b></h3>
        <p>This algorithm basically translates a mathematical formula judging the value of a page depending on both its quantity and quality of its linked pages. Each page is given a PageRank score between 1 and 10. When one page on the web links to another page, it’s counted as a vote. The more “votes” you have from high PageRank sites, the better your site is likely to perform in Google’s search results. In other terms, it follows a probability distribution representing the likelihood that a person randomly clicking on links arrives at a targeted p A probability is expressed as a numeric value between 0 and 1, for example, a 0.5 probability is expressed as a "50% chance" of redirection to a particular document.</p>
