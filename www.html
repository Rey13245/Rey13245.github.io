        <p  >Originally developed for automated information-sharing between scientists in universities and institutes worldwide, as defined by the first webpage "the world wide web is a wide-area hypermedia information retrieval initiative aiming to give universal access to a large universe of documents. <br><img src="Images\Screenshot-World-Wide-Web-project-small.png" width="600" float="400"><br>Made possible in 1989 by its inventor Sir Tim Berners-Lee and colleagues at the Geneva based European research lab "Cern", the world wide web is the leading retrieval service of the Internet, allowing access to an array of documents connected by hyperlinks.<br></p>
          <h3><b>About the creator:</b></h3>
         <p> <img src="Images\tbl.jpg" alt=""><br>
         Sir Tim Berners-Lee(born June 8, 1955, London, England) is a British computer scientist most famously credited for inventing the world wide web. His parents were also computer scientists who both worked on the Ferranti Mark 1, the first commercially built computer. He attended Sheen Mount Primary School then south-west London's Emanuel School, and then went on to graduate from Oxford university in 1976.</p><br>
         <h3>www in the making</h3>
           <p>After graduating, Berners-Lee worked as an engineer at the telecommunications company Plessey in Pool, Dorset, England. In 1978, he joined D. G. Nash in Ferndown, Dorset. Berners-Lee worked as a software engineering consultant at CERN located in Geneva from June to December 1980. While at CERN, he proposed a project and built a prototype named ENQUIRE based on hypertext, that could store information in files linked to separate files, facilitating its sharing, and updating among researchers. After leaving CERN, Berners-Lee went on to work at Image Computer Systems Ltd. For three years gaining experience in computer networking, he then returned to CERN in 1984 as a fellow.<br><br>
          As CERN became the largest Internet node in Europe, Berners-Lee proposed creating a global hypertext document system that would make use of the internet and wrote the software for the first web server “httpd“ and client “WorldWideWeb.App” , he also famously wrote: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) the web’s formatting language, URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) a web resource identifier and HTTP(Hypertext Transfer Protocol) allowing the retrieval of linked resources from across the web.
