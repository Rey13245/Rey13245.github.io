    <h1 align=center>Brief history of the Internet</h1>
<p >What started originally as a communication system for the us department of defense during the 1960s, has led to creating what is known today as the Internet.<br><br>
On October 29,1969, computers at Stanford were able to establish a host-to-host network connection for the first time, Using the first real network running on packet switching technology Named "Arpanet" after the Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA).
<br>
The following year, an Arpanet network was established between Harvard, MIT and BBN. 13 years later, on January 1st, 1983, the switch for Arpanet computers to TCP/IP protocols was completed.

<p >A year later appeared the domain name system (DNS), allowing users to easily access to addresses by remembering only the domain name, which is the converted to the IP address automatically.</p>

<p>Arpanet was internationally launched in 1973 linking the University College of London and the Royal Radar Establishment in Norway to universities in the United-States via satellite . Furthermore, in 1981, the US National Science Foundation (NSF) created the Computer Science Network (CSNET), expanding the Internet's access, eventually leading to the National Science Foundation Network (NSFNET) program, made up from (NSF) sponsored evolving projects from 1985 to 1995 promoting advanced research and education networking in the US.
<br><br>The Arpanet project ended in 1990, laying the groundwork for creating the modern Internet as we know it today.</p>
<p>Computer scientists Vinton Cerf and Bob Kahn are credited with inventing the Internet communication protocols we use today, and the system referred to as the Internet.</p><img src="Images\Vinton Cerf.jpg" float="left"><img src="Images\bob_kahn.jpg" float="right">
