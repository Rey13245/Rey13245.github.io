<h2><u>Brief history of the Internet</u></h2>
<p >What started originally as a communication system for the us department of defense during the 1960s, has led to creating what is known today as the Internet.<br><br>
On October 29,1969, computers at Stanford were able to establish a host-to-host network connection for the first time, Using the first real network running on packet switching technology Named "Arpanet" after the Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA).
<br>
The following year, an Arpanet network was established between Harvard, MIT and BBN. 13 years later, on January 1st, 1983, the switch for Arpanet computers to TCP/IP protocols was completed.

<p >A year later appeared the domain name system (DNS), allowing users to easily access to addresses by remembering only the domain name, which is the converted to the IP address automatically.</p>
<img src="Images\602c130c2edd0f001a8d5ed9.jpg" width="600" float="400">
<p>Arpanet was internationally launched in 1973 linking the University College of London and the Royal Radar Establishment in Norway to universities in the United-States via satellite . Furthermore, in 1981, the US National Science Foundation (NSF) created the Computer Science Network (CSNET), expanding the Internet's access, eventually leading to the National Science Foundation Network (NSFNET) program, made up from (NSF) sponsored evolving projects from 1985 to 1995 promoting advanced research and education networking in the US.
<br><br>The Arpanet project ended in 1990, laying the groundwork for creating the modern Internet as we know it today.</p>
<p>Computer scientists Vinton Cerf and Bob Kahn are credited with inventing the Internet communication protocols we use today, and the system referred to as the Internet.</p><img src="Images\Vinton Cerf.jpg" float="left"><img src="Images\bob_kahn.jpg" float="right">

<h2><u>The World Wide Web</u></h2>
<img src="Images\www.jpg" width="800">
<p  >Originally developed for automated information-sharing between scientists in universities and institutes worldwide, as defined by the first webpage "the world wide web is a wide-area hypermedia information retrieval initiative aiming to give universal access to a large universe of documents. <br><img src="Images\Screenshot-World-Wide-Web-project-small.png" width="600" float="400"><br>Made possible in 1989 by its inventor Sir Tim Berners-Lee and colleagues at the Geneva based European research lab "Cern", the world wide web is the leading retrieval service of the Internet, allowing access to an array of documents connected by hyperlinks.<br></p>
  <h3><b>About the creator:</b></h3>
 <p> <img src="Images\tbl.jpg" alt=""><br>
 Sir Tim Berners-Lee(born June 8, 1955, London, England) is a British computer scientist most famously credited for inventing the world wide web. His parents were also computer scientists who both worked on the Ferranti Mark 1, the first commercially built computer. He attended Sheen Mount Primary School then south-west London's Emanuel School, and then went on to graduate from Oxford university in 1976.</p><br><br>
 <h3>www in the making</h3>
   <p>After graduating, Berners-Lee worked as an engineer at the telecommunications company Plessey in Pool, Dorset, England. In 1978, he joined D. G. Nash in Ferndown, Dorset. Berners-Lee worked as a software engineering consultant at CERN located in Geneva from June to December 1980. While at CERN, he proposed a project and built a prototype named ENQUIRE based on hypertext, that could store information in files linked to separate files, facilitating its sharing, and updating among researchers. After leaving CERN, Berners-Lee went on to work at Image Computer Systems Ltd. For three years gaining experience in computer networking, he then returned to CERN in 1984 as a fellow.<br><br>
  As CERN became the largest Internet node in Europe, Berners-Lee proposed creating a global hypertext document system that would make use of the internet and wrote the software for the first web server “httpd“ and client “WorldWideWeb.App” , he also famously wrote: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) the web’s formatting language, URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) a web resource identifier and HTTP(Hypertext Transfer Protocol) allowing the retrieval of linked resources from across the web.

<h2><b><u>Google's ranking algorithm </u></b></h2>
<h3><b><u>The name that started it all</u></b></h3>
<p>“PageRank” was Google’s web searching algorithm, placing the search engine on top of all others. Currently not the one in use by Google, but certainly the most known, as it was deployed with unmatched efficiency in 1998, what allowed Google to dominate the market making its founders billionaires.</p>
<h3><b><u>How it came to be</u></b></h3>
<p>Influenced by the RankDex site-scoring algorithm for search engines results page ranking by Robin Li, a Chinese now billionaire software engineer, and by a citation analysis developed by Eugene Garfield an American linguist and businessman back in the 1950s, and by the Italian mathematician and computer scientist Massimo Marchiori’s Hyper Search, PageRank was developed at Stanford University by Sergey Brin and Larry page, hence the name “PageRank, with the help of Scott Hassan and Alan Steremberg, as part of a research project about a new search engine and published in 1998, shortly before Google Inc. was founded.</p>
<h3><b><u>How it works</u></b></h3>
<p>This algorithm basically translates a mathematical formula judging the value of a page depending on both its quantity and quality of its linked pages. Each page is given a PageRank score between 1 and 10. When one page on the web links to another page, it’s counted as a vote. The more “votes” you have from high PageRank sites, the better your site is likely to perform in Google’s search results. In other terms, it follows a probability distribution representing the likelihood that a person randomly clicking on links arrives at a targeted p A probability is expressed as a numeric value between 0 and 1, for example, a 0.5 probability is expressed as a "50% chance" of redirection to a particular document.</p>
